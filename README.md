### CSL 332 NETWORK LAB EXPERIMENTS

1. [***Multi-User Chat Server using TCP***] (https://github.com/Ashil10/Network_Lab/tree/main/1)Multi%20user%20chat%20TCP)
   - Build a chat server using TCP to allow multiple users to communicate simultaneously.

2. ***Concurrent Time Server using UDP***
   - Develop a time server using UDP that serves multiple client requests concurrently.

3. ***Distance Vector Routing***
   - Study routing algorithms where routers exchange information based on distance to destinations.

4. ***Stop and Wait ARQ Protocol***
   - Implement a protocol ensuring reliable data transmission by acknowledging each packet sent.

5. ***Go Back N ARQ Protocol***
   - Implement a protocol enabling reliable data transmission with sliding windows for efficient error recovery.

6. ***Concurrent File Server***
   - Implement a server-client architecture where the server concurrently reads a text file upon client request and sends the response back to the client.

7. ***Leaky Bucket Algorithm***
   - Implement the Leaky Bucket Algorithm to control network congestion by regulating data flow through a constant outflow rate from a buffer.
