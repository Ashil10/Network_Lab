**Network Lab Experiments**

Welcome to the Network Lab GitHub repository! Below are the experiments designed to help you grasp networking concepts effectively.

### Experiment List

1. ***Multi-User Chat Server using TCP***
   - Build a chat server using TCP to allow multiple users to communicate simultaneously.

2. ***Concurrent Time Server using UDP***
   - Develop a time server using UDP that serves multiple client requests concurrently.

3. ***Distance Vector Routing***
   - Study routing algorithms where routers exchange information based on distance to destinations.

4. ***Stop and Wait ARQ Protocol***
   - Implement a protocol ensuring reliable data transmission by acknowledging each packet sent.

5. ***Go Back N ARQ Protocol***
   - Implement a protocol enabling reliable data transmission with sliding windows for efficient error recovery.
